This is where we'll try to share about Thoth Tech, the company, our values, our culture and our
processes. It's a central guide to understand more about what we believe in and how we run the
company. As part of our value of being transparent, the handbook is open to the world and we welcome
feedback. Please create a pull request to suggest improvements or add clarifications. Please use
issues to ask questions.
