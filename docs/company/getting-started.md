# Getting Started at Thoth Tech

Welcome to Thoth Tech!

If you are reading this Getting Started Guide, then you have just enrolled in the Thoth Tech Company and we welcome you! 

This guide is a place to introduce you to the company and all the resources availible to help get you onboarded, introduce you to the comapny and products, and skilled up to tackle the Trimester ahead.

##Who are we?

The best place to start to familiarise yourself with Thoth Tech is the [company charter](docs/company/../../charter.md). This is an important guide for understanding the mission and values of the company which informs the way that the company runs and is crucial to ensuring your experience is the best it can be.

##What are our products?

Thoth Tech currently maintains and develops three external products. [OnTrack](docs/product/ontrack/ontrack.md), [SplashKit](docs//../../products/splashkit/splashkit.md) and [DreamBig](docs/product/dreambig/dreambig.md). Thoth Tech also has one internal product that is being worked on currently, called Internal Systems.

##Projects

Before you complete your onboarding form, it is recommended that you have a look at the final [Company Report](ENTER LINK HERE) from T1 2022. This will give you a good sense of what projects are currently being worked on, what skils they require, and what is needing to be completed this trimester. Please note, there may be new projects availible to be started this trimester.

##Onboarding

Now that you have familiarised yourself with the comapny, products and existing projects - the next step is for you to fill out the onboarding form so that your Senior Leadership team can allocate you a project to work on. The link for this onboarding form can be found [here] (ENTER LINK HERE).
