# Getting Started at Thoth Tech

Welcome to Thoth Tech!

If you are reading this Getting Started Guide, then you have just enrolled in the Thoth Tech Company and we welcome you!

This guide is a place to introduce you to the company and all the resources available to help get you onboarded, introduce you to the company and products, and skilled up to tackle the Trimester ahead.

## Who are we?

The best place to start to familiarise yourself with Thoth Tech is the [company charter](docs/company/../../charter.md). This is important for understanding the mission and values of the company which inform the way the company runs. Understanding and employing this charter is crucial to ensuring your, and others, experience is the best it can be.

## What are our products?

Thoth Tech currently maintains and develops three external products: [OnTrack](docs/product/ontrack/ontrack.md), [SplashKit](docs//../../products/splashkit/splashkit.md) and [DreamBig](docs/product/dreambig/dreambig.md). Thoth Tech also has one internal product that is being worked on currently, called Internal Systems.

## Projects

Before you complete your onboarding form, it is recommended that you have a look at the final [Company Report](ENTER LINK HERE) from T1 2022. You can also have a look at previous reports in this folder. This will give you a good sense of what projects are currently being worked on, what skills they require, and what is needing to be completed this trimester. Please note, there may be new projects available to be started this trimester.

## Onboarding

Now that you have familiarised yourself with the company, products and existing projects - the next step is for you to fill out the onboarding form so that your Senior Leadership team can allocate you a project to work on. The link for this onboarding form can be found [here](ENTER LINK HERE).

## Training

You should now be onboarded, so the next step while you wait to be allocated to your project is to familiarise yourself with the training and support materials that have been created so far.

The first place to start would be with the [Communication](docs/../../communication/index.md) folder. This currently contains detailed information on how to communicate professionally, how to provide and receive fearless feedback, some information about how to provide recognition to others and a writing style guide.

There are also a variety of other training resources in the [Training](docs/training) folder that provide insight into achieving a D/HD grade, a markdown guide, how to use trello and other resources.

The [useful resources](docs/useful_resources/../../../data/index.md) has a variety of resources also availible about how standups work, how to work in an agile team and about retrospectives.

There are also a variety of video workshops availible made by former students in the Thoth Tech General Files under [Recordings](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/ThothTech2/Shared%20Documents/General/Recordings?csf=1&web=1&e=3NZUHd).
