# Charter

Thoth Tech charter is important for steering our team in the right direction,
establishing boundaries, and aligning the team on how they want to work into the
future. If every member of the team is clear on their roles, responsibilities,
and purpose, they can focus on the relevant things â€” reducing the risk of
inefficiencies, misunderstandings, and duplicate work.

Our charter comprises of the following areas:

- **Mission**: As a team, what are we trying to achieve?
- **Values**: What do we care about?
- **Group norms**: How will we work together, what do we expect?
- **Roles**: What roles do we need and what are the responsibilities of each role?
- **Metrics of success**: What does success look like to us?
- **Standards of quality**: What are our standards for high quality work?
