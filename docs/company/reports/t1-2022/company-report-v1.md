## Leadership & Co

# Thoth Tech

## Company Structure and Objectives for 2022 Trimester 1

## Executive Summary

Thoth Tech (est. 2022) is a new software development company currently building from the ground up in Melbourne Australia. Thoth Tech’s mission is to build, operate, and deploy education technologies, creating tools that enhance education outcomes by empowering students, connecting them with tutors, and facilitating personalised learning experiences. We value our people, and we value excellence: We are people-focused, aim to produce sustainable products of excellent quality, and provide frameworks that provide a safe environment for learning and support of our team.

This report is for stakeholders, investors, and employees, and will outline the company structure, charter, objectives – both short and long term, and explore each product’s goals in depth.

Within the first third of 2022, Thoth Tech has recruited approximately 92 employees including four area leads, three product leads and eleven delivery leads. There will be another recruitment phase during the other two thirds of the year and an expected exit rate of 50 percent, with the potential for internships throughout the company.

Along with recruitment, Thoth Tech has taken onboard three external products, two live and well-established products – _OnTrack_ and _SplashKit_ – and _DreamBig_, a in development product which will leverage the OnTrack technology stack. Thoth Tech will also be creating our internal architecture and platform for employees throughout this third of the year, referred to as the _Internal System_ project.

Both the OnTrack and SplashKit products have been identified as requiring extensions and additional features to improve the quality and usability of the product. OnTrack is a platform designed to facilitate student learning and reducing the pressure of achieving unrealistic grades. The focus is on providing a tailored learning experience, using tasks and a portfolio assessment. This product is live and is currently being upgraded to newer technology stacks and improving security and documentation. SplashKit is currently a 2D game development Software Development Kit used to teach object-oriented coding to beginners. It has been identified that SplashKit can be expanded to explore other areas and languages. The DreamBig product is in response to a need identified by Deakin, to provide a personalised development roadmaps to enhance students’ employability.

Due to a partnership with the School of IT at Deakin University, Thoth Tech and the subsequent products are funded, supported, and leveraged by Deakin. However, all contributions by Thoth Tech members are acknowledged due to the Open-Source nature of the company. Deakin provides ground zero end-user testing and focus groups for product improvements.

# Product Overview

Thoth Tech currently has two existing products, OnTrack and SplashKit, which are open source and live to users. Thoth Tech also has two products in development, a third external product called DreamBig, and an Internal Systems product for Thoth Tech employees. Each product is being developed during this trimester.

## OnTrack

OnTrack is a platform designed to facilitate student learning by helping them achieve their unit learning outcomes and goals. It reduces pressure on achieving unrealistic grades, and importance on tailored content learning using tasks and a portfolio assessment.

This approach provides students with a simple but effective way to demonstrate their achievements and learning outcomes with the assistance of teaching staff feedback throughout the unit. OnTrack is based on Doubtfire LMS and Thoth Tech is working towards creating new and enhanced features that improve the teaching and learning experience.

**Product Lead:** Jordan Cameron Trainor

### Front-End Migration Project

#### _Overview, Goals, and Objectives_

The Front-end migration project aims to modernise the existing components that use CoffeeScript and Bootstrap, towards the cutting-edge framework, Angular with Typescript. CoffeeScript has become dated and lacks the functionality, security, and support that more modern frameworks provide. Angular, which is supported by Google, allows developers to leverage its component-based architecture to quickly create dynamic single-page applications. It is built using TypeScript, which ensures greater security as the language supports types and allows for early bug detection. Other features include templating, two-way binding, dependency injection, and extending HTML syntax without relying on third-party libraries. Moving to Angular will continue to uphold the integrity of OnTrack. TypeScript is accepted by a larger community base and includes more advanced and scalable features. Once migrations are completed, it’s possible to add more advanced and quicker features to OnTrack.

#### _Aims for Trimester_

The aim for the trimester is for each of the eight teams within the project to migrate at least one existing component and build experience to enable accelerated progress in future trimesters by supporting future team members.

#### _Deliverables_

The Front-End migration team has taken a divide and conquer approach by allocating two people into a sub-team to ensure the amount of work is well distributed. This will allow for easier communication, teamwork, and workflow for more efficient progress.

Based on existing documentation, there are 183 components remaining to migrate, however this may not be accurately updated. An analysis will be completed to ensure this is updated.

The trimester deliverables will be developing and delivering at least eight migrated components. However, the long-term project deliverables are to ensure all future teams are supported and set up for success to migrate all remaining components prior to CoffeeScript support being removed.

The functionality of the migrated components will be identical to the old ones, with a user interface design that fits in with the new OnTrack theme. Testing of these components must also be considered and implemented to ensure that the components will function as expected for students and faculty.

### Deployment Project

#### *Overview, Goals, and Objectives* 

The Deployment project aim is to create an employee-run deployment of OnTrack separated from the existing Deakin version and hosted on Google Cloud. Due to the scale of the project, there are three subgroups within the project which will focus on Google Cloud deployment, CI/CD pipeline, and enhanced authentication. The objective of the Thoth Tech hosted version of OnTrack is to allow the company to own the deployment cadence, conduct end-to-end testing, reduce risks leaking bugs upstream an innovate on new features. In addition, stakeholders will have a much more efficient setup, as well an improved process for future employees contributing to the project. The pipeline will be focused on improving software delivery with a CI/CD approach to speed up development and provide a level of quality assurance, whilst the authentication system will ensure security and privacy.

#### *Aims for Trimester* 

- Deploy a student-run version of OnTrack hosted on Google Cloud. This version will be running in isolation, independently of the Deakin University version.
- Create a CI/CD pipeline that automates the building, deployment, and validation of a of the Thoth Tech OnTrack to Google Cloud.
- Enable an enhanced authentication for user login which securely transmits data and protects stakeholder privacy.

#### *Deliverables* 

##### **Google Cloud**

Short term deliverables will be to Design and document the architecture overview and overall deployment, work collaboratively with relevant teams to automate the build, test, and deployment of OnTrack using a CI/CD pipeline, work collaboratively with relevant teams to allow for secure authentication for users of OnTrack and build a secure platform for the OnTrack deployment to be hosted on Google Cloud

Long term deliverables will be to host multiple environments (such as Production, Development, and potentially Test/Staging) of the OnTrack deployment in Google Cloud, as well as review further expansion to run multi-tenanted environments for Deakin University and other organisations within Google Cloud.

##### **Pipeline**

The short-term deliverable is that there will be an automated build CI/CD pipeline in production building and deploying OnTrack on to the Google Cloud platform and ensuring it is documented for long term usage and maintenance.

##### **Enhance Authentication**

Short term deliverables will be focusing on the empathise, define, and ideate stages - by giving more time to designing the possible solution, the team can produce a better answer. When the blueprint is out, the team will use the rest of the time to work on making the prototypes. Creating LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) servers and testing them.

Long term deliverables will be continuous maintenance, improvement, and testing of the solution.

### Jupyter Notebook Support Project

#### _Overview, Goals, and Objectives_

In the current version of the OnTrack product there is no support for submitting Jupyter Notebook ‘.ipynb’ files directly to OnTrack. As a result of this limitation, student users must export their Jupyter Notebook file as an HTML document, and then use a PDF converter to create a PDF suitable for uploading to OnTrack. This results in an inefficient, poor, and frustrating user experience.

The goal of this project is to solve this issue by allowing students to upload .ipynb files directly to OnTrack and utilise OnTrack’s PDF conversion pipeline to handle automatically converting the file to PDF format for the faculty staff to view.

The objective of this project is to help make using OnTrack a more efficient process and improve ease of use for students and staff involved in tasks that use Jupyter Notebook.

#### _Aims for Trimester_

For this trimester the Jupyter Notebook Support project team will review the existing work on this feature and create a plan to fully deliver the Jupyter Notebook file to PDF conversion feature.

#### _Deliverables_

The deliverables for this project will be the introduction of PDF conversion functionality for ‘.ipynb’ files into OnTrack, as well as documentation on the feature and a user guide on how to utilise the feature.

- Give OnTrack the ability to accept ‘.ipynb’ files directly.
- Have fully functioning ‘.ipynb’ to PDF conversion support integrated to Ontrack.
- Have a proper user guide documentation for anyone to follow and get familiar with the implemented feature.
- Keep track of how often the feature is being used as well as any failed conversions in a log.
- To make sure that the code the team write for this feature does not affect any existing features or dependencies.

Long term deliverables beyond this trimester will be the maintenance and improvement of this feature.

### Voice Verification Project

#### _Overview, Goals, and Objectives_

Currently, the OnTrack product has the functionality to accept audio submissions, but no verification system. Voice Verification for the online audio submissions will help mitigate cheating attempts and plagiarism.

In the past there have been teams who have worked on a Speaker Verification Library to validate audio files, a Speaker Verification API to wrap the library, and a Ruby app to integrate Doubtfire LMS and the Speaker Verification API. The objective of this project is to finalise a proof of concept for the Voice Verification system, deploy it to the Thoth Tech OnTrack environment, and deliver technical documentation.

#### *Aims for Trimester* 

The aim for this trimester is to work on understanding the work completed by previous teams, finish the voice verification feature, test the functionality, and create accurate documentation for the entirety of the Voice Verification system; architecture, deployment and how to user it.

#### *Deliverables* 

The short-term deliverables for this project will be upskilling, understanding, improving, integrating, testing, deploying, and developing any gaps identified in the existing pieces of work completed for the Voice Verification feature. This includes:

- A Proof-of-Concept integration of Speaker Verification on Doubtfire.
- Enrolment: Students can register their voice
- Verification: When a task submission is received, verify the attached voice file
- Deployed to the Thoth Tech OnTrack instance

There will also be the deliverable of creating documentation to ensure that the architecture, deployment, and user guides for recording voice samples for enrolment and verification.

The long-term deliverables for this project will be maintenance and improvements of this feature.

### Documentation Project

#### _Overview_

The Documentation project objective is to create documentation for the Thoth Tech company and its products, including OnTrack. The current state of documentation of Thoth Tech’s products’ is poor; with previous design decisions, updates and feature implementations not accurately documented or maintained. By clearly documenting the products Thoth Tech’s employees will be set up for success to hit the ground running when joining the company and a team. Additionally, the products’ end users, which include university students and educators, will find it easy to learn and use the products with simple and accessible documentation at hand.

The objective of the team is to create a smooth onboarding process and simplify the process of creating and managing documentation across the Thoth Tech products, for all teams. Having good documentation for the future trimesters will result in higher productivity and increasing progress.

The goals of the documentation project are to:

- Identify existing documentation
- Create a central document repository
- Enable faster search and retrieval of documents
- Streamline information and workflow
- Create documentation processes to enable other teams to effectively document their work.

#### _Aims for Trimester_

The documentation team’s aim for the trimester is to ensure everything related to Thoth Tech is efficiently and accurately documented moving forward. By collating existing documentation, analysing gaps, collaborating with development teams’, and creating new documentation, the contributions made by the documentation team will set up future team leaders and members who decide to join Thoth Tech for success.

#### _Deliverables_

The first short-term deliverable for this project is to establish documentation guidelines and processes for all teams within the company to create and organise documentation for use, operation, maintenance, design, test, and access. This will ensure accountability and compliance to documentation standards and that documentation is highly accessible. The second deliverable for this project is to analyse the Ontrack repository for relevant documentation that needs to be updated, improved, or created if none exists already. This includes design documentation, requirement documentation, user documentation for development and user guides.

The long-term deliverables are to ensure that all documentation is kept up to date with changes made to the products, and to perform the same analysis and work on the SplashKit product.

### Operations – Distribution Channels Project

#### *Overview, Goals, and Objectives* 

SplashKit is a product that has been developed to abstract away the complexities of programming languages for novice programmers. However, the toolchains and development environments required to use SplashKit can be difficult and confusing to see tup for inexperienced users. Some aspects of these issues have already been eased using SplashKit’s current install script, but it’s been observed that the initial installation process for “skm" could be further simplified.

The Distribution Channel Team intends to improve the installation process of SplashKit for new users across all three major operating systems; Windows, Linux and macOS.

The result of these improvements aims to be a single command or executable installation process that yields a working development environment for SplashKit on Windows, Linux or macOS ready for the user to start using SplashKit as quickly as possible. Decreasing the friction of the installation process aims to streamline the setup process for new users, potentially adding both product value to SplashKit – and confidence to new users.

#### *Aims for Trimester* 

The main aims for the Distribution Channel Team this trimester:

- Research the existing installation process, the SplashKit management tool “skm”, and possible methods of improved installation on all three major operating systems.
- Research and report on current known issues with respect to the installation of SplashKit on all three major operating systems.
- Report on future possibilities
- Investigate issues with Mac M1 chip devices

#### *Deliverables* 

Currently the deliverables planned for Sprint 1 will be to investigate the user and customer requirements in installing splash kit on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS (including the recent M1 chip). These deliverables are critical to the scoping of future deliverables and direction for our team as once completed, potential solutions can be determined, and tasks delegated accordingly.

The current deliverables intended for completion prior to the conclusion of sprint 1 are as follows:

- Investigate core compilation process on Linux.
  - Investigate simple one-step executable to install
- Investigate existing installation for MAC
  - Is it possible for this to be simpler?
  - Would the user benefit for a more streamlined approach?
- Investigate existing installation for Windows?
  - Could containerisation containing all dependencies be streamlined enough for users?
  - Can the dependencies be installed in one downloadable bash/PowerShell script?

Our expectation is that the information gathered will to turn these into long-term deliverables and break those down into deliverables for the upcoming Sprint 2 and 3.
