## Product Overview

## OnTrack

OnTrack is a platform designed to facilitate student learning by helping them achieve their unit
learning outcomes and goals. It reduces pressure on achieving unrealistic grades, and importance on
tailored content learning using tasks and a portfolio assessment. This approach provides students
with a simple but effective way to demonstrate their achievements and learning outcomes with the
assistance of teaching staff feedback throughout the unit. OnTrack is based on Doubtfire LMS and
Thoth Tech is working towards creating new and enhanced features that improve the teaching and
learning experience.

### Voice Verification

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

Due to the rise in contract cheating, audio submissions to the OnTrack system need to be reviewed in
order to ensure that the Speaker within the submission is the student to be submitting the work. The
long term goal of this project is to implement a Voice Verification system into OnTrack Audio
submissions. This will allow assessors to identify cheating where possible, and to discourage
students from submitting work that is not their own.

#### Aims for Trimester

The Aims for this Trimester are:

- To Test the system for a range of different audio files with multiple speakers
- Implement the Voice Verification container into the OnTrack API

#### Deliverables

Short Term:

- Test how the system responds to audio submissions with multiple different speakers
- Integration of the Voice Verification API into the OnTrack API
- Documentation of implementing the Voice Verification container into the existing OnTrack API
- Working validation of voices through a local distribution of the OnTrack API

Long Term:

- Full implementation, Testing and Documentation of Voice Verification system within the existing
  OnTrack System.

#### Project Mid-Trimester Progress

Currently Completed Tasks:

- Local distribution of OnTrack running

### File Submission Enhancements -------------------------------------------------------------------\*

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

This project aims for enhance the file submission project for the OnTrack system. By increasing the
types of files that can be used for submission to OnTrack, ease of submitting tasks for students and
importing submissions for assessors will be increased. This project mainly effects the students, as
it will reduce steps needed to submit tasks; specifically the conversion of different file types.
Long term, this project aims to document accepted file types, identify file types that can be used
for the OnTrack system, and implement and document any new file types added to the system.

#### Aims for Trimester

The aims for this trimester are:

- Increase the compatability of different file systems for submission to the OnTrack System.
- Document currently available file types.
- Implement the Jupter Notebook file type for OnTrack submissions.

#### Deliverables

Short Term:

- Implement compatability for Jupiter Notebook file submissions.
- Investigation of different file types for future integration.
- Creation of Documentation for new file type implmentation.

Long Term:

### Security Analysis

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

The aim of the Security Analysis project is to understand the vulnerabilities within the OnTrack
system, to aid in the implementation of security measures. Given that OnTrack has a high throughput
of task submission and user data, protecting the students and assessors data is paramount for
ensuring that both technical system remain secure. This will effect all users of Ontrack, as well as
the ongoing development of the OnTrack system.

#### Aims for Trimester

The aims for this trimester are:

- Creation of documentation on testing standards to be used in the OnTrack project.
- Testing of OnTrack systems for vulnerabilities.
- Creation of testing documents for existing parts of the OnTrack system.

#### Deliverables

Short Term:

- Identification of current security vulnerabilities.
- Creation of testing standards.
- Documentation of issues and proposed fixes.

Long Term:

- Further ongoing testing of the OnTrack system for vulnerabilities.
- Implementation of fixes for identified security vulnerabilities.
- Further documentation of vulnerabilities and proposed fixes.

#### Project Mid-Trimester Progress

Currently Completed Tasks:

- Creation of Github and Trello Resources
- Research for Authenitcation and Authorisation Services
- Meeting with Hardhat Industries to initiate Security Analysis

### User Interface Enhancement

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

The overarching goal of this project is to migrate the current components, which utilise
CoffeeScript and Bootstrap, to Angular framework with Typescript. CoffeeScript has outlived its
usefulness and falls short of more contemporary frameworks in terms of support, functionality, and
security. Developers can easily design dynamic single-page applications using Angular because to its
component-based architecture. As TypeScript provides types and enables early problem identification,
its use in its construction ensures improved security.

#### Aims for Trimester

The aims for this trimester are:

- Use bottom-up progression to migrate at existing components
- Restrict the conflicts between the old and new components
- Gain experience to enable speedier growth in future trimesters

#### Deliverables

Short Term:

- Develop and deliver at least 5 migrated components
- Carry on the components that are in the middle of migrating in last trimester

Long Term:

- Ensure all migrated components have been tested and function as expected by implementing test
  units.
- Prior to CoffeeScript support being removed, make sure that future team members are supported and
  set up for success to migrate all remaining components

#### Project Mid-Trimester Progress

Currently Completed Tasks:

- Creation of List of files to migrate from CoffeeScript to Typescript
- Initiated migration of 5 sections, with 2 completed.
