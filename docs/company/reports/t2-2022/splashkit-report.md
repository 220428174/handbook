### Operations

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

The Operations team are responsible for delivering developments at a system level. This includes
foundational project, installation processes ('skm'), bug fixes and solutions to ongoing system
level problems.

This team has a goal of taking last trimesters existing research and extending on that to succeed in
delivering an installation process that is effectively 'one-click' and compatible across all
operating systems.

The team also has the objective to research and document the possibility (or lack thereof) of a
browser based IDE implementation, and should a viable approach exist, design and document an
approach to take to make this feasible.

#### Aims for Trimester

The aim for this trimester is to

- Design a bespoke SplashKit installer

### Applications - Arcade Machine

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

This trimester, the arcade machine team has a solid foundation to build on, given the creation of a
Windows application capable of cloning the games repository, and executing the games on a playable
interface. The work of last trimester allows the team of this trimester to take closer steps to
creating a physical arcade machine. The machine will perform similarly to a Multi-Game Arcade
Machine, allowing users to select a game from a local library of games. Objectives include:

o Software which:

- Is cross platform compatible
- Allows for game compilation on the host machine
- Is authored to be consistent with a chosen programming convention/style guide
- Implements an architecture that ensures long term maintainability is possible for future
  contributors

o The development of:

- A programming convention / style guide document
- Other General Project Documentation

o Research of:

- Appropriate tooling that can be used to assist with these objectives
- Unit tests and determining if they have any value for the project

Additional features which may be considered later in the lifecycle of the project include the
development and deployment of a website which:

o Supports the uploading of games o Stores and displays:

- User Reviews
- High Scores and Achievements

#### Aims for Trimester

The aim of this trimester is to enhance the existing application to accommodate cross-platform
compatibility. This will include developing methods to facilitate the compilation of games on the
host machine. Access to the game library will be offered through the platform where the user can
configure settings and select and play their desired game. If time permits, a physical Arcade
Machine will be designed and manufactured however the software platform is the primary focus for the
trimester.

#### Deliverables

Short-term

- Decoupling functional behaviour and modularising existing software
- Adding support for all three major operating systems
- Adding support for locally compiled games on the host machine
- Completion of an options menu
- Discussing and agreeing upon a programming convention and style
- Addressing style inconsistencies throughout the projectâ€™s source code
- Producing documentation around the project

Long-term

- Physical Arcade Machine built using RaspberryPi

#### Progress

The team have made excellent progress, covering:

- Finalising the automation of the game reviewal process
- Documented a coding standard for developers to follow
- Refactoring codebase to use specified standard
- Refactoring the includes to each respective file that requires them
- Research and documentation on cross platform compatibility
- Refactoring the options menu

The team have also developed:

- Database class for creating databases
- Table class for creating tables
- Methods of standard database queries
- Rating class to handle game rating

Moving forward, the teams goals have shifted to:

- Implementing server based compilation of games
- Implementing realtime loading
- Implementing optional display methods
- Liaising with hardware construction teams
- Developing a design for the hardware

#### Final Status

This team has made remarkable developmental progress of the Arcade Machine software this
trimester.  
Early on, heavy focus was put on refactoring the code base to meet style and conventions guidelines.
This included:

- Major refactoring of tightly coupled components has been completed
- Separation of implementation logic and definitions has been completed
- Revised build process has been implemented allowing for a faster incremental build process with
  the implementation of a `Makefile`
- Documentation covering source code style and convention has been authored

The team recognised and prioritised the necessity of cross-platform application support early on,
especially considering the goal for this software to be executed using RaspberryPi, a Linux
system.  
This ensured the following tasks:

- Support for Windows, macOS and Linux was prioritised and has been completed
- Further cross-platform compatibility added through identification and resolution of previously
  undetected bugs

Good time and task management has been a crucial aspect of this teams success.  
Each member has selected a task to implement a new feature:

- Database class and methods to interact with MySQL database tables - Zac Brydon
- Ability to add a rating to games (ratings are stored in the database) - Riley Dellios
- Play time durations of each game (durations are stored in the database) - Zac & Riley
- A full re-design of the Options menu to comply with the standardised architecture - Anthony George
- New, dynamically generating 'Credits' screen - Lachlan Foy
- New, dynamically generating 'About' screen - Richard Douglas-Denton

The above features have been thoughtfully designed and implemented to allow for future development
to easily adapat to the architecture.

The design of the Arcade Machine architecture demands dependancy on other Thoth Tech repositories to
operate correctly. One of these repos is the
[arcade-games](https://github.com/thoth-tech/arcade-games) repository. As the designs show, the
Arcade Machine fetches new games from this repo on startup, requiring several things:

- Validation to ensure the content being downloaded is not malicious
- Validation to ensure the config.txt file has been included and completed
- Validation to ensure the content being downloaded contains pre-compiled executables (the Arcade
  Machine does not apply builds)

To accomodate this, we have developed and tested the following through the use of 'GitHub Actions':

- Automated validation of contributed games
- Automated cross-platform game compilation scripts have also been completed.

Development has progressed to the implementation of hardware where the following development has
been completed:

- Creation of automated Arcade Machine startup scripts for RaspberryPi
- Modification of `splashkit/skm` to accomodate Raspbian OS
- Testing the Arcade Machine software on:
- Windows, Linux Manjaro, Linux Ubuntu, macOS
- RaspberryPi Zero (performs poorly)
- RaspberryPi 3 B+ (performs well with GPU acceleration, with some artefacts to address)
- RaspberryPi 4 (performs as exepected)

#### Future Development

There is still plenty of scope for this project to expand and progress.  
The team have identified areas for improvement, with focus on how RaspberryPi hardware performs.  
Focus should be given to:

- Documentation has been partially added, but requires additions
- Address why the software runs slow on models older than RaspberryPi 4
- Options menu is now effectively a 'blank canvas', inviting further development of new features to
  take advantage of newly implemented database facilties

### Applications - Build An Exceptional Game

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

This trimester, this team will collaborate as a unit to create a single game of exceptional class
and quality.

The goal is to make a game so good it is worthy of commercial release. The intension here is to
showcase to the world, the power of the SplashKit SDK, and encourage developers to develop games
using the engine. This trimester's student developers will aim to utilise as many methods that
SplashKit has to offer in order to â€˜advertiseâ€™ SplashKitâ€™s ability as a game engine.

The long-term objectives will showcase how by using SplashKit, game development quality can be
achieved such that the product created is of a high enough professional standard, the game can be
made available commercially. Synchronously, the game will be showcased on the arcade machine in
development.

#### Aims for Trimester

The aim for this trimester is to

- Compartmentalise the tasks to focus teams on specific areas of games development (Design,
  Mechanics, Animations, Collisions, AI, etc)
- Construct UML and foundational designs and specifications
- Generate pixel style artwork acording to references found on Trello and acquire sound assets
  suitable to specifications
- Game Music is made to fit the style of the game
- Develop the foundations of the game
- Create game functionality, intro animations, menu, options, credits, etc

#### Deliverables

Short-term

- A decided genre of game (1 or 2 player puzzle platform game)
- UML Class diagrams and other designs
- Team creations and task allocations
- Acquisition and creation of assets
- Class creation
- Level Editor created to export level text files.
- Documentation

Long-term

- Commercially releasable game, developed using the Splashkit SDK
- this game will be easily extendable by future teams (using documentation provided in build-a-game
  repository and level editor)
- The current collisions used will be updated to use the new Splashkit rectangle-rectangle collision
  function once available to use.

#### Progress

The team have made excellent progress, covering:

- Design Document including lore of the game 'Below the Surface', design decisions and reference
  images
- Creating pixel styled visual assets using piskel to create spritesheets of a standard 64x64 size
  for use in game and level editor
- Music Created appropriate to the style of the game, and more is being made.
- pick up and place function for moving pipes
- Created functional Menu screen, Credits and GameOver screen.
- Current levels made to include intuative pipe puzzles
- Creating the HUD displaying the players lives and health
- Different enemy behaviours for each enemy created (roach, snake, blob, flies (3 types), rat and
  water rat / boss).
- Creating an epic boss battle for level 10
- instructional MarkDown files on how to create levels using the level editor and how to load these
  txt files into the game for testing at level 1.

The team have also developed:

- A Level Editor that exports level information in a txt file to create new levels (The Level Editor
  can use many layers however, 2-4 is recomended. player and door must be placed on layer 1)

Moving forward, the teams goals have shifted to:

- Being able to drop a pipe if a different one is needed first (near place of player when dropped)
- There are two sound effect errors that only occur on mac (toxic waste and rain sound effects)
- (optional) a spider enemy added to the game.
- (optional) more levels!
- When uploaded to the Arcade Games Repository and played through the Arcade Machine there was a
  segmentation error where the game would occasionally crash at different points. we must find where
  and why this error is happening. (and fix it)
- Game will be uploaded to Arcade Games Repository (again) for use on the Arcade Machine once the
  above is completed.

#### Final Status

- Below the Surface (game) has 12 levels in total
- 3 easy levels
- 2 moderately difficult levels
- 2 hard levels
- slime surfin' level where player must fall without dying
- 2 non pipe puzzle levels where the focus is on combat.
- 2 bonus levels only accessible through password entry
- 4 different music tracks created specifically to fit the style of the game
- A password entry load level function
- A challenging 1 player game
- A very challenging 2 player game! (if player2 out of window player2 dies AND if either player is
  out of lives it is game over)
- Game was uploaded to Arcade Games repository for testing through Arcade Machine reposetory.

### Modules Enhancements

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

The Splashkit modules team has an exciting semester ahead of them, with each module in a position to
have deliverable components completed.

The machine learning module had a working reinforcement learning agent that can play turn based
games. Refactoring and code review was performed on the physics module, but external dependencies on
the Box2D library has left the module requiring a major refactor. This refactor would mean that
Splashkit would contain a native physics engine. The data analytics module has a structure for a
dataframe, pending it passing code review and testing.

Objectives for the modules project include:

- Building multiple machine learning agents utilising different algorithms to be used by developers
  for different features
- Create a 2D physics engine within SplashKit, allowing physics to be easily added to objects within
  a project
- Implement a dataframe structure that loads structured data and create an API that allows a data
  scientist to pre-process, transform and visualise the data.

With the addition of these modules, there is potential for Splashkit to be utilised in a greater
capacity within more disciplines. Building the data analytics module allows for more focused classes
to be designed for data science students, rather than only using Splashkit for building games. Both
the physics and machine learning modules will advance the quality and capability of games and
animations built while using Splashkit.

#### Aims for Trimester

The primary aim for this trimester is to have the reinforcement learning agent ready to use by
developers and to complete the first stage of deliverables for the physics and data analytics
modules. These initial deliverables are to complete the basic dataframe for data analytics and to
replace the existing Box2D library uses with native methods.

Secondary aims for the semester are to create a neural network agent, develop plots and
visualisations from the data in the dataframes and to begin creating methods for gravity, sinking
and projectile motion.

#### Deliverables - Data Analytics

Short-term

- Finish code review
- Load data row by row and column by column
- Working Dataframe with descriptive and transformative methods
- Build a way to display plots and subplots

Long-term

- Fully functioning dataframe
- Data type objects
- Full preprocessing method suite
- Multiple data visualisation methods created
- Integration with machine learning

#### Deliverables - Machine Learning

Short-term

- Create games to test reinforcement learning agent against different game styles
- Begin building neural network agent

Long-term

- Continue adding machine learning models as agents
- Create easy to call methods for developers to utilise these agents

#### Deliverables - Physics

Short-term

- Finish code review
- Refactor code to remove dependency on Box2D
- Create methods for sprite collisions, object collisions and gravity

Long-term

- Create a fully functioning 2d physics engine within Splashkit
- Expand the methods to include physics such as sinking, inertia and others

#### Progress

The modules team has made great progress so far this trimester, such as:

- Data Analytics:
  - Code review that began in trimester 1 of 2022 has been completed. As part of this review,
    recommendations were made on removing string matching and regex code and overhauling the
    dataframe constructor.
  - Redesigning of the dataframe constructor was completed, with potential options for data
    structures discussed in the team. The most efficient choice was to utilise vectors with the
    variant data type.
  - Methods for inserting data into the dataframe column by column and row by row were created and
    tested.
  - Creation of missing documentation and review of current documentation was conducted.
  - Plans for the short term direction of the Data Analytics module were created.
- Machine Learning
  - Upgrades on the matrix_2d library were designed, implemented and tested
  - All current documentation was reviewed and updated where necessary.
  - Plans for the short term direction of the Machine Learning module were created.
- Physics
  - Full review of the existing code for the Physics module has began.
  - Creation of missing documentation and review of current documentation was conducted.

The modules team is working on the following:

- Data Analytics
  - Designing a way for column data types to be manually converted without inserting a new column
    and deleting the old.
  - Creating a custom NULL data type to use in the dataframe. This will work with the current
    exclusive data type column structure.
  - Designing the functionality for dataframes to be populated via comma separated value (CSV) or
    text files. Null and column data types must be completed first.
- Machine Learning
  - Designing a scalable way to calculate the gradient during back-propogation for neural networks.
  - Reviewing the proposed upgrade for the matrix_2d library
- Physics
  - Finalising the review and report on the current Physics implementation (both the existing
    collisions API and the forked Physics API).
  - Designing and implementing methods for rectangle to rectangle collisions. This can be utilised
    by the Build an Exceptional Game team as custom hit-boxes for sprites.

By the end of the trimester the Modules team hopes to:

- Data Analytics
  - Have the functionality to create, display and modify data in the dataframe.
  - Have the functionality to read and write dataframes to and from CSV/text files
  - Design and begin implementing the Data Visualisations API.
- Machine Learning
  - Be able to predict non-linear patterns using a fully connected neural network
  - Be able to use neural networks to create Artificial Intelligence for games
- Physics
  - Have the required methods in the Collisions API created for use in the Build an Exceptional Game
    team
  - Creation of a Gravity API that contains functionality for freefall, terminal velocity and
    sinking.

#### Final Status

- Data Analytics
  - Dataframe constructor has been completed
  - Data can be inserted as a vector of values as either a row or a column
    - Will check to ensure that the data types are correct for each column
      - Throws an invalid argument if they don't match
  - Individual cells can be updated and retrieved
  - A null value has been specifically built for the dataframe to aid with functionality
  - A save to csv function has been implemented
  - The dataframe and its individul columns and rows can be displayed in the terminal
  - Work on finalising basic methods for datatype conversion is in progress, currently waiting on
    finalisation of a pull request review:
    [pull request #22](https://github.com/thoth-tech/splashkit-core/pull/22)
  - Load CSV function yet to be finalised
  - Dataframe can be created and have data points added and changed.
