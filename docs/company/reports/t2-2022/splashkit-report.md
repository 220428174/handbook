The Operations team are responsible for delivering developments at a system level. This includes
foundational project, installation processes ('skm'), bug fixes and solutions to ongoing system
level problems.

This team has a goal of taking last trimesters existing research and extending on that to succeed in
delivering an installation process that is effectively 'one-click' and compatible across all
operating systems.

The team also has the objective to research and document the possibility (or lack thereof) of a
browser based IDE implementation, and should a viable approach exist, design and document an
approach to take to make this feasible.

#### Aims for Trimester

and quality.

The goal is to make a game so good it is worthy of commercial release game. The intension here is to
showcase to the world, the power of the SplashKit SDK, and encourage developers to develop games
using the engine. This trimester's student developers will aim to utilise as many methods that
SplashKit has to offer in order to â€˜advertiseâ€™ SplashKitâ€™s ability as a game engine.

The long-term objectives will showcase how by using SplashKit, game development quality can be
achieved such that the product created is of a high enough professional standard, the game can be
made available commercially. Synchronously, the game will be showcased on the arcade machine in
development.

#### Aims for Trimester

### Modules Enhancements

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

The Splashkit modules team has an exciting semester ahead of them, with each module in a position to
have deliverable components completed.

The machine learning module had a working reinforcement learning agent that can play turn based
games. Refactoring and code review was performed on the physics module, but external dependencies on
the Box2D library has left the module requiring a major refactor. This refactor would mean that
Splashkit would contain a native physics engine. The data analytics module has a structure for a
dataframe, pending it passing code review and testing.

Objectives for the modules project include:

- Building multiple machine learning agents utilising different algorithms to be used by developers
  for different features
- Create a 2D physics engine within SplashKit, allowing physics to be easily added to objects within
  a project
- Implement a dataframe structure that loads structured data and create an API that allows a data
  scientist to pre-process, transform and visualise the data.

With the addition of these modules, there is potential for Splashkit to be utilised in a greater
capacity within more disciplines. Building the data analytics module allows for more focused classes
to be designed for data science students, rather than only using Splashkit for building games. Both
the physics and machine learning modules will advance the quality and capability of games and
animations built while using Splashkit.

#### Aims for Trimester

The primary aim for this trimester is to have the reinforcement learning agent ready to use by
developers and to complete the first stage of deliverables for the physics and data analytics
modules. These initial deliverables are to complete the basic dataframe for data analytics and to
replace the existing Box2D library uses with native methods.

Secondary aims for the semester are to create a neural network agent, develop plots and
visualisations from the data in the dataframes and to begin creating methods for gravity, sinking
and projectile motion.

#### Deliverables - Data Analytics

Short-term

- Finish code review
- Load data row by row and column by column
- Working Dataframe with descriptive and transformative methods
- Build a way to display plots and subplots

Long-term

- Fully functioning dataframe
- Data type objects
- Full preprocessing method suite
- Multiple data visualisation methods created
- Integration with machine learning

#### Deliverables - Machine Learning

Short-term

- Create games to test reinforcement learning agent against different game styles
- Begin building neural network agent

Long-term

- Continue adding machine learning models as agents
- Create easy to call methods for developers to utilise these agents

#### Deliverables - Physics

Short-term

- Finish code review
- Refactor code to remove dependency on Box2D
- Create methods for sprite collisions, object collisions and gravity

Long-term

- Create a fully functioning 2d physics engine within Splashkit
- Expand the methods to include physics such as sinking, inertia and others

#### Progress

The modules team has made great progress so far this trimester, such as:

- Data Analytics:
  - Code review that began in trimester 1 of 2022 has been completed. As part of this review,
    recommendations were made on removing string matching and regex code and overhauling the
    dataframe constructor.
  - Redesigning of the dataframe constructor was completed, with potential options for data
    structures discussed in the team. The most efficient choice was to utilise vectors with the
    variant data type.
  - Methods for inserting data into the dataframe column by column and row by row were created and
    tested.
  - Creation of missing documentation and review of current documentation was conducted.
  - Plans for the short term direction of the Data Analytics module were created.
- Machine Learning
  - Upgrades on the matrix_2d library were designed, implemented and tested
  - All current documentation was reviewed and updated where necessary.
  - Plans for the short term direction of the Machine Learning module were created.
- Physics
  - Full review of the existing code for the Physics module has began.
  - Creation of missing documentation and review of current documentation was conducted.

The modules team is working on the following:

- Data Analytics
  - Designing a way for column data types to be manually converted without inserting a new column
    and deleting the old.
  - Creating a custom NULL data type to use in the dataframe. This will work with the current
    exclusive data type column structure.
  - Designing the functionality for dataframes to be populated via comma separated value (CSV) or
    text files. Null and column data types must be completed first.
- Machine Learning
  - Designing a scalable way to calculate the gradient during back-propogation for neural networks.
  - Reviewing the proposed upgrade for the matrix_2d library
- Physics
  - Finalising the review and report on the current Physics implementation (both the existing
    collisions API and the forked Physics API).
  - Designing and implementing methods for rectangle to rectangle collisions. This can be utilised
    by the Build an Exceptional Game team as custom hit-boxes for sprites.

By the end of the trimester the Modules team hopes to:

- Data Analytics
  - Have the functionality to create, display and modify data in the dataframe.
  - Have the functionality to read and write dataframes to and from CSV/text files
  - Design and begin implementing the Data Visualisations API.
- Machine Learning
  - Be able to predict non-linear patterns using a fully connected neural network
  - Be able to use neural networks to create Artificial Intelligence for games
- Physics
  - Have the required methods in the Collisions API created for use in the Build an Exceptional Game
    team
  - Creation of a Gravity API that contains functionality for freefall, terminal velocity and
    sinking.
