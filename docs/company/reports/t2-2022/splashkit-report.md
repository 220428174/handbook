### Applications - Arcade Machine

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

This trimester, the arcade machine team has a solid foundation to build on, given the creation of a
Windows application capable of cloning the games repository, and executing the games on a playable
interface. The work of last trimester allows the team of this trimester to take closer steps to
creating a physical arcade machine. The machine will perform similarly to a Multi-Game Arcade
Machine, allowing users to select a game from a local library of games. Objectives include:

o Software which:

- Is cross platform compatible
- Allows for game compilation on the host machine
- Is authored to be consistent with a chosen programming convention/style guide
- Implements an architecture that ensures long term maintainability is possible for future
  contributors

o The development of:

- A programming convention / style guide document
- Other General Project Documentation

o Research of:

- Appropriate tooling that can be used to assist with these objectives
- Unit tests and determining if they have any value for the project

Additional features which may be considered later in the lifecycle of the project include the
development and deployment of a website which:

o Supports the uploading of games o Stores and displays:

- User Reviews
- High Scores and Achievements

#### Aims for Trimester

The aim of this trimester is to enhance the existing application to accommodate cross-platform
compatibility. This will include developing methods to facilitate the compilation of games on the
host machine. Access to the game library will be offered through the platform where the user can
configure settings and select and play their desired game. If time permits, a physical Arcade
Machine will be designed and manufactured however the software platform is the primary focus for the
trimester.

#### Deliverables

Short-term

- Decoupling functional behaviour and modularising existing software
- Adding support for all three major operating systems
- Adding support for locally compiled games on the host machine
- Completion of an options menu
- Discussing and agreeing upon a programming convention and style
- Addressing style inconsistencies throughout the project’s source code
- Producing documentation around the project

Long-term

- Physical Arcade Machine built using RaspberryPi

### Applications - Build An Exceptional Game

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

This trimester, this team will collaborate as a unit to create a single game of exceptional class
and quality.

The goal is to make a game so good it is worthy of commercial release game. The intension here is to
showcase to the world, the power of the SplashKit SDK, and encourage developers to develop games
using the engine. This trimester's student developers will aim to utilise as many methods that
SplashKit has to offer in order to ‘advertise’ SplashKit’s ability as a game engine.

The long-term objectives will showcase how by using SplashKit, game development quality can be
achieved such that the product created is of a high enough professional standard, the game can be
made available commercially. Synchronously, the game will be showcased on the arcade machine in
development.

#### Aims for Trimester

The aim for this trimester is to

- Compartmentalise the tasks to focus teams on specific areas of games development (Design,
  Mechanics, Animations, Collisions, AI, etc)
- Construct UML and foundational designs and specifications
- Acquire artwork and sound assets suitable to specifications
- Develop the foundations of the game
- Create game functionality, intro animations, menu, options, credits, etc

#### Deliverables

Short-term

- A decided genre of game
- UML Class diagrams and other designs
- Team creations and task allocations
- Acquisition of assets
- Class creation
- Documentation

Long-term

- Commercially releasable game, developed using the Splashkit SDK

### Modules Enhancements

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

The Splashkit modules team has an exciting semester ahead of them, with each module in a position to
have deliverable components completed.

The machine learning module had a working reinforcement learning agent that can play turn based
games. Refactoring and code review was performed on the physics module, but external dependencies on
the Box2D library has left the module requiring a major refactor. This refactor would mean that
Splashkit would contain a native physics engine. The data analytics module has a structure for a
dataframe, pending it passing code review and testing.

Objectives for the modules project include:

- Building multiple machine learning agents utilising different algorithms to be used by developers
  for different features
- Create a 2D physics engine within SplashKit, allowing physics to be easily added to objects within
  a project
- Implement a dataframe structure that loads structured data and create an API that allows a data
  scientist to pre-process, transform and visualise the data.

With the addition of these modules, there is potential for Splashkit to be utilised in a greater
capacity within more disciplines. Building the data analytics module allows for more focused classes
to be designed for data science students, rather than only using Splashkit for building games. Both
the physics and machine learning modules will advance the quality and capability of games and
animations built while using Splashkit.

#### Aims for Trimester

The primary aim for this trimester is to have the reinforcement learning agent ready to use by
developers and to complete the first stage of deliverables for the physics and data analytics
modules. These initial deliverables are to complete the basic dataframe for data analytics and to
replace the existing Box2D library uses with native methods.

Secondary aims for the semester are to create a neural network agent, develop plots and
visualisations from the data in the dataframes and to begin creating methods for gravity, sinking
and projectile motion.

#### Deliverables - Data Analytics

Short-term

- Finish code review
- Load data row by row and column by column
- Working Dataframe with descriptive and transformative methods
- Build a way to display plots and subplots

Long-term

- Fully functioning dataframe
- Data type objects
- Full preprocessing method suite
- Multiple data visualisation methods created
- Integration with machine learning

#### Deliverables - Machine Learning

Short-term

- Create games to test reinforcement learning agent against different game styles
- Begin building neural network agent

Long-term

- Continue adding machine learning models as agents
- Create easy to call methods for developers to utilise these agents

#### Deliverables - Physics

Short-term

- Finish code review
- Refactor code to remove dependency on Box2D
- Create methods for sprite collisions, object collisions and gravity

Long-term

- Create a fully functioning 2d physics engine within Splashkit
- Expand the methods to include physics such as sinking, inertia and others
