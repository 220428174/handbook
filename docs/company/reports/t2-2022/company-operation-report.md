##### Aims for Trimester Status 

The Company Documentation team aimed to create, manage, maintain, and improve the state of company
documentation, company policies around transition and people operation. To meet the aim the team had
to:

- Review the current state of documentation across the company (including company handbook)
- Identify gaps or areas of improvement
- Create new documentation, including templates, in order to address these areas
- Continue to think critically about the documentation needs of the company and create additional
  documentation to accommodate such needs
- Work to the best of our abilities to create meaningful and high quality documentation

In this aspect, the team has achieved all of these requirements to varying degrees. Current
documentation was reviewed many times and if needed was updated and improved upon. For any gaps
identified new documentation, including templates was created to accommodate such needs.

##### Deliverables Status 

###### Short-term

All of the short term goals set at the beginning of the trimester have been meet. The first goal was
to create Various documentation to supplement current documents in order to better company needs,
which can be seen in documents such as the "Geting Started Guide", "Remote Working Guide" and
"Password Guidelines". Other documentation was Updated, improved and integrate where needed as well,
including those outside of the handbook. The handbook was reviewed and improved upon many times to
better the state of documentation across the whole company. Some help with product specific
documentation was provided to other team to operate there documentation effectively.

###### Long-term

The long term goals remain the same and the team should continue work on achieving theses
deliverables.

- All company policies, guides, and Onboarding and Offboarding procedures within Thoth Tech need to
  be reviewed and be updated, improved, or created if none exists already.
- Improvements to the Company Handbook
- Enhancing company policies and procedures

A focus should also be put one on ensuring previous decisions, design, and requirements are easily
accessible to all future users, developers, and other stakeholders so relevant context is provided
for all work in the future.

##### Project Recommendations

- It is recommended that all project members review the company handbook, this will allow them to
  answer any questions other teams may have about the handbook, company operation or documentation.
  The reviewing of the company handbook also allow project members to identify any missing documents
  that they can add or updated and improved existing documentation in the Handbook. This is
  recommended to be done at the start of each trimester.
- Documentation team members should ensure templates are existing or developed for all document
  types and team activities.
- A report should be produced with recommendations and expectations for current project teams to
  implement for documentation of their projects
- Collaboration with other project teams should take place to ensure the documentation repository is
  being utilised for all company and project information. This team will should also be responsible
  for upholding the expectations of documentation across the company.

##### Blockers

There are no blockers that will affect the continuation of this project. The only blockers are on an
individual level, there where:

- Trouble with formatting files for GitHub as idetified by the GitHub Checks
- Communication between project members
