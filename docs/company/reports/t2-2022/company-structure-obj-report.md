# Thoth Tech - Company Structure and Objectives for Trimester 2 2022

## Executive Summary

Thoth Tech (est. 2022) is a new software development company currently building from the ground up
in Melbourne Australia. Thoth Tech’s mission is to build, operate, and deploy education
technologies, creating tools that enhance education outcomes by empowering students, connecting them
with tutors, and facilitating personalised learning experiences. We value our people, and we value
excellence: We are people-focused, aim to produce sustainable products of excellent quality, and
provide frameworks that provide a safe environment for learning and support of our team.

This report is for stakeholders, investors, and employees, and will outline the company structure,
charter, objectives – both short and long term, and explore each product’s goals in depth.

Within the first third of 2022, Thoth Tech has recruited approximately 92 employees including four
area leads, three product leads and eleven delivery leads.

The second third of 2022 has seen Thoth Tech grow to approximately 104 employees, including five
product leads and sixteen delivery leads.

There will be another recruitment phase during the last third of the year, with the potential for
internships throughout the company.

Along with recruitment, Thoth Tech has taken onboard three external products, two live and
well-established products – **OnTrack** and **SplashKit** – and **DreamBig**, a in development
product which will leverage the OnTrack technology stack. Thoth Tech will also be creating our
internal architecture and platform for employees throughout this third of the year, referred to as
the **Internal System** project.

Both the OnTrack and SplashKit products have been identified as requiring extensions and additional
features to improve the quality and usability of the product. OnTrack is a platform designed to
facilitate student learning and reducing the pressure of achieving unrealistic grades. The focus is
on providing a tailored learning experience, using tasks and a portfolio assessment. This product is
live and is currently being upgraded to newer technology stacks and improving security and
documentation. SplashKit is currently a 2D game development Software Development Kit used to teach
object-oriented coding to beginners. It has been identified that SplashKit can be expanded to
explore other areas and languages. The DreamBig product is in response to a need identified by
Deakin,to provide a personalised development roadmaps to enhance students’ employability. Due to a
partnership with the School of IT at Deakin University, Thoth Tech and the subsequent products are
funded, supported, and leveraged by Deakin. However, all contributions by Thoth Tech members are
acknowledged due to the Open-Source nature of the company. Deakin provides ground zero end-user
testing and focus groups for product improvements.

## Company Structure

The Company is broken up based on product, with the product leads spread company wide. There is a
tier system built into the company structure – directors, product leads, delivery leads, then team
members. This structure is primarily about support, guidance, and feedback, rather than authority.
Each employee has chosen their own role title based on their interests, skills, experience and what
they want to develop.
