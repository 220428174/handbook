# Thoth Tech - Company Structure and Objectives for Trimester 2 2022

## Executive Summary

Thoth Tech (est. 2022) is a new software development company currently building from the ground up
in Melbourne Australia. Thoth Tech’s mission is to build, operate, and deploy education
technologies, creating tools that enhance education outcomes by empowering students, connecting them
with tutors, and facilitating personalised learning experiences. We value our people, and we value
excellence: We are people-focused, aim to produce sustainable products of excellent quality, and
provide frameworks that provide a safe environment for learning and support of our team.

This report is for stakeholders, investors, and employees, and will outline the company structure,
charter, objectives – both short and long term, and explore each product’s goals in depth.

Within the first third of 2022, Thoth Tech has recruited approximately 92 employees including four
area leads, three product leads and eleven delivery leads.

The second third of 2022 has seen Thoth Tech grow to approximately 104 employees, including five
product leads and sixteen delivery leads.

There will be another recruitment phase during the last third of the year, with the potential for
internships throughout the company.

Along with recruitment, Thoth Tech has taken onboard three external products, two live and
well-established products – **OnTrack** and **SplashKit** – and **DreamBig**, a in development
product which will leverage the OnTrack technology stack. Thoth Tech will also be creating our
internal architecture and platform for employees throughout this third of the year, referred to as
the **Internal System** project.

Both the OnTrack and SplashKit products have been identified as requiring extensions and additional
features to improve the quality and usability of the product. OnTrack is a platform designed to
facilitate student learning and reducing the pressure of achieving unrealistic grades. The focus is
on providing a tailored learning experience, using tasks and a portfolio assessment. This product is
live and is currently being upgraded to newer technology stacks and improving security and
documentation. SplashKit is currently a 2D game development Software Development Kit used to teach
object-oriented coding to beginners. It has been identified that SplashKit can be expanded to
explore other areas and languages. The DreamBig product is in response to a need identified by
Deakin,to provide a personalised development roadmaps to enhance students’ employability. Due to a
partnership with the School of IT at Deakin University, Thoth Tech and the subsequent products are
funded, supported, and leveraged by Deakin. However, all contributions by Thoth Tech members are
acknowledged due to the Open-Source nature of the company. Deakin provides ground zero end-user
testing and focus groups for product improvements.

### Modules Enhancements

#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

The Splashkit modules team has an exciting semester ahead of them, with each module in a position to
have deliverable components completed.

The machine learning module had a working reinforcement learning agent that can play turn based
games. Refactoring and code review was performed on the physics module, but external dependencies on
the Box2D library has left the module requiring a major refactor. This refactor would mean that
Splashkit would contain a native physics engine. The data analytics module has a structure for a
dataframe, pending it passing code review and testing.

Objectives for the modules project include:

- Building multiple machine learning agents utilising different algorithms to be used by developers
  for different features
- Create a 2D physics engine within SplashKit, allowing physics to be easily added to objects within
  a project
- Implement a dataframe structure that loads structured data and create an API that allows a data
  scientist to pre-process, transform and visualise the data.

With the addition of these modules, there is potential for Splashkit to be utilised in a greater
capacity within more disciplines. Building the data analytics module allows for more focused classes
to be designed for data science students, rather than only using Splashkit for building games. Both
the physics and machine learning modules will advance the quality and capability of games and
animations built while using Splashkit.

#### Aims for Trimester

The primary aim for this trimester is to have the reinforcement learning agent ready to use by
developers and to complete the first stage of deliverables for the physics and data analytics
modules. These initial deliverables are to complete the basic dataframe for data analytics and to
replace the existing Box2D library uses with native methods.

Secondary aims for the semester are to create a neural network agent, develop plots and
visualisations from the data in the dataframes and to begin creating methods for gravity, sinking
and projectile motion.

#### Deliverables - Data Analytics

- Finish code review
- Load data row by row and column by column
- Working Dataframe with descriptive and transformative methods
- Build a way to display plots and subplots

Long-term

- Fully functioning dataframe
