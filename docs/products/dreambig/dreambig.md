# DreamBig

DreamBig is a new system innovation driven by the School of IT at Deakin. This will help students
develop their professional identity across their course - helping better prepare them at graduation
to smoothly enter the IT profession.â€‹

## What are the goals for DreamBig?

DreamBig is at its early inception and need a passionate team to shape its future. We would like to
build a prototype and can help to achieve the following:

- Multi-dimensional visualisation of each student's growing professional identity
- Used within curriculum to encourage engagement.
- Scaffolds reflections on industry-readiness
- Increases awareness of important milestones and dates for graduate recruitment and internships
- Customised paths for careers starters, career changers and career advancers.

For the technical architecture, it would be suggested to lean on the established pattern set out by
OnTrack project. However, this is subjected to change and the team is empowered to explore
alternatives as they see fit.
