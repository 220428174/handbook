# OnTrack

## What is OnTrack?

OnTrack is a web assessment tool that provides students with a task oriented
approach to portfolio assessment to stay aligned by completing tasks as part
of their learning. More information can be found on the OnTrack [website](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/help/about-clouddeakin/help-guides/assessment/ontrack).

## What are the goals for OnTrack?

The OnTrack group is to focus on the maintenance and development of Doubtfire. [Doubtfire](https://doubtfire.io/guides/overview) is a learning management system which is used at Deakin University by both students and staff. The group has been tasked with creating new features to enhance both the teaching experience for tutors and learning experience for students.
