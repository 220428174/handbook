# Documentation Epic

## Background / Context

The OnTrack project has been worked on for many years by external consultants who have not contributed efficiently and effectively. As a result of this, documentation containing the information about design decisions, requirements and user information is not accurate or up to date within our OnTrack product.

## Business Value

To ensure that all work is usable,and the decision-making process is visible for future stakeholders, the business would like to retrospectively analyse any gaps in the documentation of our products and produce documentation. This will ensure previous decisions, design, and requirements are easily accessible to all future users, developers, and other stakeholders so relevant context is provided for all work in the future.

## In Scope

Design Documentation
User documentation (high level)
User guides (step by step how to)
Requirement documentation

## Out of Scope

New feature documentation
User research documentation

## What needs to happen

The Ontrack repo needs to be analysed for relevant documentation that needs to be updated, improved, or created if none exists already.

- A report should be produced on what has been found from this analysis with the proposed solutions for prioritisation.
- A report of recommendations and expectations for current project teams to implement for documentation of their projects.

## Assumptions / Dependencies

- Existing documentation is usable

## UX/UI Considerations

Do we provide a documentation template/or visual standardfor each category?

## Analytics Considerations

N/A

## Reg & Compliance Considerations

N/A

## Operations / Support / Training Considerations

Advise project teams of relevant documentation releases

## What are the challenges?

Aligning the existing documentation with current version of product

## Acceptance criteria(Informal)

- Validate documentation with managing directors
- Clear organisation and accessibility of documentation
- Guidelines are set for all future documentation
- Documentation produced is accurate to current version of products
