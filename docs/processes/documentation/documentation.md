## Introduction

Documentation is one of the most important parts of any software epic. It is imperative to remember, you will not be working on the capstone projects forever and that there will be people taking your place within Thoth Tech.

Documentation is the official information that is provided by the company for users and contributors. Documentation should provide clarity around troubleshooting and provide users and those involved with a basic idea of what it is the platform does and how it works.

The Thoth Tech documentation should all be stored in the documentation repositry within the company GitHub. All documentation should be stored in a .md format and anything to do with research, meeting minutes and updates, should be stored within the [documentation repositry] (https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation).

## Why is it important?

Without documentation, there is no record of:

- Choices and Decisions
- Why functionality is added
- What processes are
- How users use the tool
- What project updates have been added
- And more

Thoth Tech documentation is not only used by the one respective team. The documentation can be accessed at any time by any of the Thoth Tech company members just to see where a project is heading and what progress has been made. Additionally, should other teams wish, they may collaborate and think of intuitive ways in which to further improve the projects.

## Guidelines

When documenting, we recommend you consider the following when writing your documentation:

- Clear
- Useful
- Friendly
- Appropriate
- Consistent
- Accessible

Further to this, we ask you consider the following:
- Tone:
    - Causal, yet still formal
- Language:
    - Avoid jargon/slang
        > Avoid jargon and slang that a junior member may not understand. If you do use an abbreviation, be sure to describe it.
    - Active voice
        > Yes: Marti logged into the account.
        > No: The account was logged into by Marti.
    -Write positively
    -Second person
- Titles
- Screenshots and Images
- Delivery Speed
