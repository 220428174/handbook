## Why/What is QA?

QA (Quality Assurance) is defined as a procedure to ensure the quality of software products or services provided to the customers by an organisation. Quality assurance focuses on improving the software development process and making it efficient and effective as per the quality standards defined for software products.

## Testing and Development

The [Testing and Development processes document](testing-and-dev.md) explains the test driven development (TDD) process and contains information relating to feature development using this approach. As it makes testing part of the approach, it is best to be familiar with this document before you start coding.

It covers key areas including:

- [Feature Development: where to start?](testing-and-dev.md#_Feature_development_%E2%80%93)

- [Test-Driven Development](testing-and-dev.md#_Test_Driven_Development)

- [Epics and User Stories](testing-and-dev.md#epics-and-user-stories)

- [Testing Templates](testing-and-dev.md#testing-templates)
