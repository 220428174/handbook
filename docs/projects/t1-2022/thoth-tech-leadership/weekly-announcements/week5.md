# Week 5 General Announcement

Good Evening Thoth Tech.

Here is this week's update from your friendly neighbourhood leadership team.

First and foremost, congratulations on the excellent feedback on Task 2.1! It
was a team effort and everyone deserves a pat on the back.

## OnTrack tasks

For D/HD aiming students, you should start working on Task 5.1 this week.

If you need some guidance, please watch the D/HD workshop

It is beneficial for everyone.

Please also spend some time looking at Task 6.x. For D/HD aiming students, there
are 4 tasks that due on the same day on Sun 24/04/2022. Preparation is crucial
so we don't scramble close to the due day.

  to help us understand the company learning and development needs and plan for
  resources.
- Please review the Quality Assurance (QA)
  [document](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/processes/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-overview.md)
  and start a conversation around the topic with your team. There will be a
  session on this during the week (Wed 6/04/2022 6:00 PM - 6:45 PM) and it is
  open to everyone.
- Please review the Communication
  [Guide](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/communication/communication.md)
  and see if it can help to streamline your team communication process.
- Any seniors who want to mentor, please reach out to the Leadership team.
- Any juniors who would like to work towards leadership next trimester, we are
  organising an Expression of Interest for attending the leadership conference.
  Please stay tuned for more information.
- Please work on the relevant project repositories from **the Thoth Tech
  organisation**. Please do not pull or push to the original Doubtfire or
  SplashKit repositories.

## What you can expect

- Showcase for D/HD students is being organised at the end of the week. We would
  like to present project Trello boards, plans, testing & data strategies to the
  Managing Directors. It would be a great opportunity to receive feedback.
  Please speak to your Delivery Leads to confirm as soon as possible.
- We are transitioning away from MS Word to Thoth-tech
  [handbook](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook) repository on GitHub
  starting from this week onward.
- We are planning for more training in the next weeks so please watch out for
  invites in your mailbox or subscribe to the
  [shared calendar](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/group/deakin365.onmicrosoft.com/_thoth-tech/view/month).

## What we can expect

- We expect that Trello boards should be planned out and upskilling should
  already be happening. If you need help, please reach out
- Team members should feel comfortable with GitHub and creating pull requests.
  Please review the training
  [video](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/ThothTech2/Shared%20Documents/General/Recordings/24-3-22%20Github%20Repos%20QnA.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=Pa3Hh0)
  and the QA
  [document](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/processes/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-overview.md)
  if you are still unsure. If you have done both of these things and still feel
  lost, please reach out to the Area Leads.
- While there is a focus on students having responsibility for sourcing their
  work in Capstone, if a student finds themselves with nothing to do and is
  unsure, they should, at a minimum, speak to their team leader to ask "what can
  I do?". Even if you are only looking for a pass grade, it is up to you to make
  sure you have work to demonstrate requirements.

Thank you for all your continuing work, and have a great week!
