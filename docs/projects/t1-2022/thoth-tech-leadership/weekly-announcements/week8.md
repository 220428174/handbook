# Week 8 Announcement

Good Evening Thoth Tech

It’s your friendly neighbourhood leadership team here.

## RECAP:

- Thank you to the 31 responses in the Onboarding feedback form. This will be invaluable information
  for next trimester. We are happy to report a 4/5 stars for on-boarding, hopefully next tri it will
  reach a 5/5 experience.
- By now you should have all reviewed the all company meeting where we reviewed what we have
  achieved so far, what we still need to achieve and what new resources have become available since
  the beginning of trimester.

## TO DO:

- As we approach the end of the trimester, we are moving into Delivery and Documentation mode. If
  you are lost or need help - PLEASE REACH OUT. We can’t support you if you don’t let us know you
  need help.
- As you should now be aware from the company meeting, there is a new documentation repo. Please
  begin putting your research and development notes into the corresponding folder. This is expected
  to be completed in time for handover (Week 11) and will require you to create PRs in .md format.
  If you start now you will have no issues. Remember to add people from your project and docs team
  to review the Pull Request.
- We would love some input regarding your project key results and the data required to validate
  that. Please see the Project metrics template for some guidance. The key results are not only
  restricted to the product. They can encompass delivery and people. For example, successfully
  up-skill 100% of team members on TypeScript, etc.
- T2 2022 questionnaire: JUNIORS please fill this out to assist with ensuring you are placed
  appropriately next year and get a chance to take on roles and growth opportunities of interest.
  This is your chance to have your say.
- Test strategy: has your team completed yours? This is an important part of the Quality Assurance
  process and should exist before you start coding. Reminder, a sample Test Strategy template is in
  the handbook. If you have particular testing resources and skills, there will be opportunities to
  express interest this week to help out your fellow Thoth-Tech company members.
- Remember to book into your calendars, next Monday 9th of May, Daniel from Midnyte City is
  presenting a guest session all around Experience working in Industry. It’s at 12-1pm so you can
  dial in over lunchtime. Daniel has real world delivery lead experience, so this is a great
  opportunity to gain valuable insight into the real world and enhance your capstone leadership
  learnings and will be a good cohort contribution for your OnTrack Tasks.
