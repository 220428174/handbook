# Week 4 General Announcements

Good Evening Thoth Tech

Here is this week's update from your friendly neighbourhood leadership team.

You should be starting to feel more comfortable with **GitHub this week** – if not please watch the Github workshop session; it’s valuable to review if you are new to all things git!

Your team **Trello board** should be continuing to fill out. This week there should be a focus on task assignment, analysis of existing repos to understand the full scope of work, upskilling requirements, research and planning.

Start to think about your **individual retrospectives**; what evidence do you have so far? What do you want to learn more of? Are there any areas you think you need to work on?

**D/HD aiming students** should also be thinking about and working on their 5.1 task. If you feel like you may not be meeting the standard or want to get a better understanding, talk to leadership about how we can give you more responsibility/opportunities/help you understand. Note there are 4 tasks due on the same day for HD students.

There are also upcoming opportunities for D/HD students in the pipeline – watch this space!

All **OnTrack tasks** now have task sheets and resources where applicable. Note that any tasks that start with “Company” are group, company-wide submissions; the rest are individual. All employees by now should have **reviewed the rubric** to ensure they understand what they need to do for their desired grade. If you want to chat about requirements – reach out.

We will also be releasing a **Quality Assurance** document this week with **guidelines on branching and commit etiquette.**

Thank you for all your continuing work, and have a great week!
