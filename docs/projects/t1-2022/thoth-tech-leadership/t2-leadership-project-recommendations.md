# T1 Leadership Project Recommendation for T2

## General recommendations

- Clear messaging early on
- Clear messaging from the beginning around general delivery schedule + self driven expectations
- Weekly written team progress reports to Area Leads
- Partnering experienced seniors with juniors where possible
- Balance of High achieving students to drive the delivery
- Product Lead + Area lead merged
- Addition of more area leads
- QA team
- Documentation team part of Internal Systems
- Delivery lead training in week 0

Implement recommendations from T1 Delivery leads

## Onboarding form improvements:

- skill confidence (1-5) eg. programming, troubleshooting, documentation, project collaboration etc
- do you want to work towards leadership?
- Grade aims in onboarding form for team splits

## OnTrack

### Front-end Migrations

- Upskilling links - migration guide
- Front end experience, JavaScript/TypeScript
- Utilising seniors early on
- Partnering experienced seniors with juniors
- Smaller meetings early on
- Possibly two teams
- 1 lead per 3/4 teams of 2

### Deployment

- Similar number of people - pipeline maybe 1 person
- Make Google Cloud + Pipeline 1 sub group
- Mat & Lachlan to take over google cloud work
- Enhance Authentication: Balance of ComSci student + Cyber

### Jupyter Notebook

- Skills: good understanding of the programming language python so they can learn ruby-on-rails
  quickly. The work that I would expect them to do has many similarities to that of python and i
  feel that if they understand python they will have no difficulty understanding ruby.
- Size: 2-3 students
- Other options available if the next trimester team finishes early or if they get to many people
  such as other conversion types. This is the same as how this trimester the Jupyter Notebook
  Support team not only did the Jupyter Notebook to PDF conversion but also Microsoft Word to PDF.

### Voice Verification

- 5-6 is more than enough including delivery lead
- Documentation focus + writing documentation
- Higher balance of seniors to juniors
- High confidence in programming
- Balance of High achieving students to drive the delivery

### Documentation

- Move toward a Document Control role, having ownership over documentation and product documents.
- Size: 6-10 students, sub teams for each product
- Skills: good understanding of English language, understanding of markdown, strong engagement,
  strong communication, and experience with GitHub
- Good for people wanting to avoid coding, but still technical understanding to approve work.

## SplashKit

### Extensions

- Touch base with Andrew to get more insights on the deliverables
- Set up regular cadence with Andrew to surface any blockers early on
- Require better documentation to help understand what is done and what is not yet completed
- Leadership
  - Jack and Ben are good, highly engaged, and self-started. They help to lead retrospective.

## Modules

- Machine Learning: Harry is doing really well. AI agent, change rewards, temporal differences.
  Working on documentation. Might get all complete this Trimester.
- Data Analytics: focus on new instance selection, standardisation, visual plots.
- Physics: work on the extension code after addressing existing code issues
- Blocker: full-time work commitment. Keeping up with delivery across small sub-teams. We needs to
  establish better communication process.
- We should try to focus more on documentation.
- Leadership
  - Tim stood in a lot of time to help. Trello experience and agile planning.
  - Harry is proactive. However, he would like to remain technical.
- Ideas
  - Junior can join and get more mentorship.
  - Clearer description/expectation on roles.
  - Balance technical learning and leadership responsibilities was particularly hard. Could we have
    leadership dedicated for technical track? For example, technical lead/staff engineer.

## DreamBig

## Internal Systems

### Static Company Website

- 6 - 8 people + delivery lead - will help with engagement
- JavaScript
- QA focus + skills
- Skills needed: Front end - Gatsby - React, backend: JavaScript + TypeScript

## DreamBig Prototype

- T2 will be working on user evaluation of the UI prototype to be completed in this trimester.
- Also high priority will be given to coding the prototype of the application, using the same tech stack as Ontrack.
- 8 people (hope to keeep current juniors (4) and perhaps onboard 4 more people).
- Looking for skills in React, node js (and ruby rails or Angular knowledge be great).
