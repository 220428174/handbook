##OnTrack

###Front-end Migrations

- Upskilling links - migration guide
- Front end experience, javascript/typescript
- Utilising seniors early on
- Partnering experienced seniors with juniors
- Smaller meetings early on
- Possibly two teams
- [ ] 1 lead per 3/4 teams of 2

###Deployment:

- Similar number of people - pipeline maybe 1 person
- Make Google Cloud + Pipeline 1 sub group
- Mat & Lachlan to take over google cloud work
- Enhance Authentication: Balance of ComSci student + Cyber

###Jupiter Notebook:

- Skills: good understanding of the programming language python so they can learn ruby-on-rails quickly. The work that I would expect them to do has many similarities to that of python and i feel that if they understand python they will have no difficulty understanding ruby.
- Size: 2-3 students
- Other options available if the next trimester team finishes early or if they get to many people such as other conversion types. This is the same as how this trimester the Jupyter Notebook Support team not only did the Jupyter Notebook to pdf conversion but also microsoft word to pdf.

###Voice Verification:

- 5-6 is more than enough including delivery lead
- Documentation focus + writing documentation
- Higher balance of seniors to juniors
- High confidence in programming
- Balance of High achieving students to drive the delivery

###Documentation:

- Move toward a Document Control role, having ownership over documentation and product documents.
- Size: 6-10 students, sub teams for each product
- Skills: good understanding of English language, understanding of markdown, strong engagement, strong communication, and experience with GitHub
- Good for people wanting to avoid coding, but still technical understanding to approve work.
