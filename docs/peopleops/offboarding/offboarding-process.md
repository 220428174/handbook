# Offboarding process

Handover and offboarding of employees is an important process for a number of reasons:

- data security and risk management;
- efficient organisation and company administration;
- a chance to get final feedback and review from exiting members; and
- a opportunity to place the company in a strong position to continue developing projects that run
  across capstone trimesters.

## Update and correctly store all relevant documents

Ensure that all projects' documentation and processes are up-to-date and have been stored in the
correct location of the relevant [Thoth Tech repository](https://github.com/thoth-tech) on GitHub.
Documentation should be clear enough for subsequent members to easily follow, understand and, as
necessary, continue work on projects.

## Handover Document

Complete handover document and showcase according to the capstone requirements for the relevant
trimester. Ensure ALL relevant PR or document links are included. Ensure a markdown copy of the
handover document is uploaded to the relevant
[Thoth Tech repository](<(https://github.com/thoth-tech)>)

## Exit Survey

Exiting seniors should undertake the
[Senior Exit Interview](https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPage.aspx?origin=NeoPortalPage#FormId=7Hgj0IgW1UaFQBwotfRw9mRQ8baZZ01Ep6tAGY0fXmNUNDZUSVM3R0UzRDc3UDgxQkdCVVIzVUNHWS4u)
survey so that feedback can be collected and assessed to allow the Thoth Tech leadership to see what
went well and what opportunities for improvement may exist.

Juniors should complete the

form to give the leadership team (current and incoming) an opportunity to reassess the member's role
