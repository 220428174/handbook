# Onboarding process

Onboarding is incredibly important at Thoth Tech. We don't expect you to hit the
ground running from day one.

We highly recommend taking at least one full day for onboarding. Please feel
free to participate in your team's work in the first two weeks, but don't feel
like you are under heavy pressure. We are here to help.

All onboarding steps are in the onboarding issue template which is owned by the
Leadership Team. The onboarding process for the new team member is self-driven
and self-learning, whilst also remaining as asynchronous as possible.

- [ ] Thoth Tech charter helps to steer the ways we work and is a living document.
      It is documented, refined and revised based on lessons learned in the course of doing business.
      Please familiarise yourself with our [Charter](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/company/charter.md).

## Products

We have two main products at Thoth Tech: OnTrack and SplashKit. Depending on
which team you are working with, you are expected to have some good level of
understanding about the product and how to set it up. Please follow the
applicable product onboarding below.

- [ ] See [OnTrack onboarding](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/products/ontrack/ontrack.md)
- [ ] See [SplashKit onboarding](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/products/splashkit.md)

## Social

Starting in a new team can be overwhelming, how about schedule some calls with your team members. The leadership
team would also love to chat. There's no need to ask people if it's okay to schedule a call first. Schedule a
meeting using Schedule Assistant in the Outlook calendar. Be sure to introduce yourself in the invite.
