# Formatting

## Headings

Headings should be clear and concise. All content should relate to the heading or provide links to other information sources.

Article headings should not be in a question format.

Use h1 (#) for article headings.

## Subheadings

Subheadings are used to highlight a specific paragraph or area of content. All content should apply to this specific subheading.

Avoid multi-tiered subheadings, use a maximum of three layers as a guide. If you need more than three layers, consider creating a separate article.

Subheadings can be in a question format where appropriate.

Use h2 (##) or h3 (###) for subheadings. Choice depends on the layer.

## Notes

Information that is outside the scope of the content should be placed as a note if it necessary for the reader to understand.

Content within a note should be separate from the content, short and to the point. A link to more information can be provided within the note section

## Hyperlinks

Consider using hyperlinks (links) to ensure all information is relevant only to the article at hand

When an article references information that is out of scope, the reader can be linked to other information sources.

For example:

More information can be found here

## Lists

Put a colon at the end of the lead sentence.

Use a capital letter to start every dot point and a full stop at the end of the last dot point.

To create a bullet list in markdown:

- Use a dash

To create a numbered list in markdown:

1. Use 1. The first number in the list will be the starting number

## Text formatting

Italics is reserved for titles and legislations, or user input.

Bold is used for emphasis.

Font and text size will be relative to the html due to the nature of markdown.

## Numbers

Use words for one to nine and numerals for 10 and over

For numbers over 999, use a comma for clarity

25,000 or 3,000,000

Unless the number is paired with a symbol

3 cm or 2.75

For complex numbers, use a combination

2.5 million $57,800

## Sentences

The purpose of a sentence is to deliver a single message. The average sentence will have a length of 15-20 words.

A variety of sentence lengths will engage your reader.

Put qualifying phrases, conditions, and explanations into separate sentence.

If you want to elaborate on the same point in a new sentence, use words like &#39;also&#39;, &#39;further&#39;, or &#39;however&#39;.

If there are multiple points in a single sentence, consider using several shorter sentences, dot points, colons, or notes.

Maintain order in paragraphs.

If a sentence establishes an order, explain each item in the same order. This will help with flow and consistency.

Avoid repetition and redundancy.

Aim for lean, efficient, and concise sentences.

# Writing

## Acronyms

Acronyms are useful to simplify a sentence.

If you use an acronym, always spell out the title at first use, followed by the acronym in brackets.

For example:

This is the Quality Assurance (QA) process. For all QA information refer to this article.

## Capitalisation

Capital letters are to be use on proper nouns.

All writing will follow sentence case, including headings.

###

## Verbs

Verbs should be written in the present tense.

Be consistent with your tense.

## Active voice

Use active voice when you want the writing to be simple, direct, clear, and easy to read.

Active voice emphasises the verb.

Sentences are structured as subject \&gt; verb \&gt; object

Passive voice is used for feedback, preserving a relationship, and when the subject is unknown.

## Avoid nominalisation

Avoid nominalisation as it can distract the reader and make the writing dull or heavy.

Nominalisation is a type of &#39;abstract noun&#39;. The name of a process, technique, or emotion.

For example:

| **Verb**    | **Nominalisation** |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Complete    | Completion         |
| Introduce   | Introduction       |
| Provide     | Provision          |
| Fail        | Failure            |
| Arrange     | Arrangement        |
| Investigate | Investigation      |
| Use         | utilisation        |

## Technical content

When writing technical content, always consider the audience&#39;s skill.

Use industry specific terms when writing for a professional audience.

Define technical terms in the context they are referred to.

When appropriate, assume the reader understands the fundamentals. If you are unsure, provide a link to more thorough information.

Use frequently used words where possible.

If a term already exists, do not create a new word/phrase. Use these terms consistently throughout the article, and across Thoth Tech.
