# Communication

At Thoth Tech, our employees work remotely in various timezones and have
different commitments outside of work. It is important for us to practice
clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more
efficiently.

To accomplish this, we stay as open and transparent as we can and bias towards
asynchronous communication as starting point.

We place emphasis on documentation and ensure that decisions and conclusions
are written down and accessible to everyone in the company.

## Tips and practices

1. You are not expected to be available all the time. There is no expectation
   to respond to messages outside of your planned working hours.
1. All company data should be shareable by default.
1. It is OK to ask as many questions as you have. Please do them in a way so
   many people can answer them and many people see the answer. Use Pull Requests
   or public chat channels instead of direct messages.

## Shoutouts

Recognition is a key transformative tactic. Showing appreciation to team members
contributions influences engagement behaviour, and acknowledges to team members
that their work is seen.

1. Shout out to people that did a great job in our `Shoutouts!` MS Teams channel.
   Everyone in the company is in this channel so please don't be shy.
1. Consider other channels where recognition can be acknowledged: team meetings,
   etc.
1. Please be as timely as possible with your recognition.
