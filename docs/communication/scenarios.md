# Communication scenarios <!-- omit in toc -->

At Thoth Tech, the Area Leads have identified a number of communication scenarios which can be
difficult to manage. In each scenario there are different outcomes and courses of action.

- [Company communication](#company-communication)
- [Technical difficulties](#technical-difficulties)
- [Swapping teams](#swapping-teams)
- [Time zone management](#time-zone-management)
- [Late Onboarding](#late-onboarding)
- [Conflict management](#conflict-management)
- [Bullying, abuse, or harassment](#bullying-abuse-or-harassment)

## Company communication

All Thoth Tech communications to and between company members should be clear and consistent. Most
communications, including announcements, will be posted in Microsoft Teams. This applies for all
levels of company communication – the main Thoth Tech channel, product channels, and private team
channels. As such, these channels and their respective communications should create a flow-down
effect of communication from Leadership and Managing Directors to all company members.

From such communication, all Thoth Tech members should feel aware of what tasks need to be
completed, and that they are continually supported and guided. If at any time you are unsure or feel
that there is insufficient communication regarding tasks, there are several points of contact:

- Your Team Lead
- Fellow Team Members
- The Area Lead.

It is always better to seek assistance sooner rather than later. Remember that your peers are there
to support you, so don’t hesitate to send them a message if you’re feeling uncertain.

## Technical difficulties

As part of being a member of Thoth Tech, utilising a range of technologies is key for company
engagement and contributions. For any technology, there is always the chance that there are some
difficulties encountered. This may be during the installation and set-up processes, or may occur
during general usage of the technology.

In any case, there are courses of action that can be taken when technical difficulties are
encountered. When communicating what the technical difficulty is, please remember to provide any
relevant:

- Screenshots (including commands run and output generated, or what appears on-screen after an
  action)
- System details (for example, Operating System or version number of software)
- General background details which directly assist in explaining the issue.

These aspects all assist in creating a clearer understanding of the problem and what could
potentially be done to solve it. Hence, providing as much relevant information as possible is
important.

### Course of action 1 – Reach out to fellow team members

Reaching out to fellow team members is a great course of action in the case of technical
difficulties. Because your team members will be working with the same technologies to complete their
tasks, they may be able to assist in developing a solution. In fact, they may have encountered the
same issues in the past and know the solution.

The best way to contact your team members is through posting a message on the team’s private Teams
channel. Or, if you’d prefer, you can reach out to individual team members or the Team Lead through
a private chat. Either way, always remember that your team members are there to support you through
any challenges encountered in completing tasks, including tech issues.

### Course of action 2 – Reach out on the MS Team’s Product Channels

Each of the Thoth Tech products – OnTrack, SplashKit, and DreamBig – have their own dedicated
Microsoft Teams channel. The Company Operations teams also have a similar dedicated channel. These
channels are also a place where posts can be published to ask for assistance in dealing with an
encountered technical difficulty. As people from numerous teams are within this channel, and all
work with the same technology stack, someone can likely assist with the encountered problem.

The best method for requesting assistance in this channel is to create a post which describes the
specific problem, including screenshots where relevant. To ensure that the message is seen, it is
also a good idea to “tag” the channel in the post. This sends a notification to all channel members,
and can be done by typing “@channel-name” within the post.

### Course of action 3 – Reach out to the Area Lead

After reaching out and receiving assistance from fellow team members and product channel members,
your Area Lead can be contacted if the technical difficulty persists. This can be done through
sending them a private Teams message. Remember to describe the issue and explain how you have worked
through the other communication courses of action. As the Area Lead is highly experienced in working
with the product and its technologies, they will be able to assist in developing a solution.

## Swapping teams

At the end of each member’s first trimester with the company, they nominate which team they would
like to be in for their senior trimester. They have the option to remain in the same team, or to
change to another – even within a different product. This is the ideal time to swap teams, as it is
based on your interests and what you’d like to achieve in the company.

If you wish to swap teams at any other point, it is a more complex process and is not guaranteed to
be approved. In this case, valid reasons must be given to support the desire to swap teams. Your
Team Lead and Area Lead are the best points of contact in this scenario.

Should your desire to swap teams come from experienced conflict, bullying, abuse, or harassment,
please refer to the sections of this guide which discuss these scenarios. The advice and courses of
action given may assist in these scenarios and alleviate the need to swap teams.

## Time zone management

Thoth Tech is based in Melbourne, Australia. As such, all meeting and event times communicated
throughout the company are assumed to be in the AEDT/AEST conventions.

For members outside this time zone, it is expected that they manage the conversions into their own
local time independently. Thoth Tech understands that the differences in time zones may make it
difficult for such members to attend live meetings. If so, please contact your team members to
arrange a better meeting time where possible.

As team meetings are recorded, these are also available to be viewed so that all members are
up-to-date on team information. Any personal updates on progress, including weekly tasks and any
challenges encountered, can then be communicated in the team channel. Conducting
[asynchronous meetings](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/reduce-or-replace-meetings-with-asynchronous-methods-1673e0d9-7ab0-40a3-bbdb-9d821146135d)
with team members is also another option which can assist in overcoming time differences for team
meetings.

Ultimately, ensuring that communication is open and that other members are aware of any time zone
differences is essential. Your team members are there to support you, so reach out to clarify
deadlines or to ask for support should managing time differences become difficult.

## Late Onboarding

When first starting out at Thoth Tech, there is a lot to explore and learn about the company and the
technologies used. Onboarding is a key part of this process, containing several tasks and resources
to help new junior members in getting started. Onboarding is also completed again during your time
as a senior with Thoth Tech.

In the case of late Onboarding, it is likely that other team members have already completed their
Onboarding and are now working towards their company contributions. Should this be the case, there
are several actions which can assist in getting “up to speed”:

- Importantly, introduce yourself to your team and let them know that you are going through the
  process of Onboarding
- Watch the recordings of any team and company meetings that have occurred
- Reach out to your Team and Area Leads for guidance regarding what contributions you can make that
  best suit your skill set and interests.

While late Onboarding may make you feel “behind” in the company, remember that your team and peers
are there to support you through the process. Ensure that you reach out to your peers as needed, and
soon enough you will be caught up and contributing within the company.

## Conflict management

As part of Thoth Tech’s values, it is expected that all members engage in
[professional communication](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/communication/professional-communication.md)
that is polite and considerate. Regardless, we recognise that there may be conflicts that arise due
to differing opinions or other factors. While differences of opinion or disagreements are not a
conflict, unkind words and actions used in discussing them can escalate the situation to a conflict.

In the case of a conflict, there are key communication avenues that can assist in resolving it:

1. Take some time to step away from the conversation (whether it’s in-person or online) before
   responding. This allows any strong emotions to subside so that responses are less emotionally
   charged.
2. Reflect on the situation and try to understand the other person’s/people’s point of view. This
   can help in finding “middle ground” between conflicting parties.
3. Contact the person/people involved in the conflict and attempt to work through it together.
   Remember to be considerate and kind, allowing each other to share their thoughts without
   interruption.
4. If needed, reach out to a suitable, neutral third-party (someone not directly involved in the
   conflict), such as a member of Leadership. This third-party can act as a peer mediator between
   the conflicting parties to assist in working through the conflict.

## Bullying, abuse, or harassment

As part of Thoth Tech’s values, it is expected that all members engage in
[professional communication](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/communication/professional-communication.md)
that is polite and considerate. It is also expected that all Thoth Tech communication and
collaboration environments are a safe and welcoming place for all members. As with any workplace,
**bullying, abuse, and harassment are unacceptable under any circumstances and will be actioned
upon**.

If, at any point in your time with Thoth Tech, you experience - or witness - bullying, abuse, or
harassment **report it to the Managing Directors immediately**. Disciplinary action will be taken
against those perpetrating the behaviour.

Should the behaviour occur over digital means, try to collect evidence of it through screenshots or
recordings. We acknowledge that this may increase the negative effects felt from the behaviour, and
the Managing Directors are there to help you through this. Your peers are also there to support you
through this experience.
