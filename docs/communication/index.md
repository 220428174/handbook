# Communication

At Thoth Tech, our employees work remotely in various time zones and have
different commitments outside of work. It is important for us to practice
clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more
efficiently.

To accomplish this, we stay as open and transparent as we can and bias towards
asynchronous communication as starting point.

We place emphasis on documentation and ensure that decisions and conclusions
are written down and accessible to everyone in the company.

## Guidelines

1. All announcements to Thoth Tech general channel only
2. Use channels for all general to major discussion
3. Use chat / direct message for private or personal discussion
4. Use GitHub Pull Requests for feedback on code or documentation
5. Use Trello for planning and assigning tasks
6. Use meetings for synchronous discussion _(for private channels, record and store the meeting in the channel files)_
7. Use whiteboard tools (Miro or MS) to collaborate in meetings
